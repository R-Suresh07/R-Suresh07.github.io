I build AI systems at VFS Global that process thousands of documents daily across visa applications for 110+ countries. The work sits at this interesting intersection of production engineering and research, where you need systems that are both highly reliable and honest about their limitations.

The problems I've been running into while building these systems don't really have solid solutions yet. When you're processing critical documents at scale, you need vision-language models that can not only extract information accurately but also know when they're uncertain. Existing approaches fall short, so I've been exploring ways to make AI systems in the vision domain more grounded and certain about their outputs.

This gap between what production systems need and what current research offers is what drives my work. I'm particularly interested in how reasoning models differ from instruct models when it comes to uncertainty, and whether we can build better frameworks for detecting when models are actually hallucinating versus just being uncertain.

On the side, I'm wrapping up my B.Sc. in Programming & Data Science from IIT Madras and working on a couple of papers about VLM calibration that I'm planning to publish soon.

Always happy to chat about uncertainty quantification, VLMs, or anything at the intersection of production ML and research. Feel free to reach out.

**Research interests:** Uncertainty quantification, vision-language models, hallucination detection, epistemic uncertainty in agentic systems
