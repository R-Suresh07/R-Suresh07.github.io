I build production AI systems at VFS Global processing documents across 110+ countries. My research interests focus on uncertainty quantification in vision-language models, particularly detecting when models are uncertain versus hallucinating.

Currently wrapping up my B.Sc. in Programming & Data Science from IIT Madras and working on papers about VLM calibration.

Always happy to chat about research or engineering problems so feel free to reach out.
