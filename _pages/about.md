I'm a Lead AI Research Engineer at VFS Global, where I build production AI systems that process 180,000+ documents daily while pushing the boundaries of uncertainty quantification in vision-language models.

My work bridges the gap between production ML engineering and research—I design systems that need to be both highly reliable and technically innovative. At VFS Global, I've built intelligent document processing pipelines with 99.1% accuracy, automated passport validation across 110+ nationalities, and developed novel confidence estimation frameworks that combine logit-based filtering with semantic entropy analysis.

My research focuses on making AI systems more trustworthy through better uncertainty quantification and hallucination detection. I'm particularly interested in how reasoning models differ from instruct models in their calibration properties, and I'm developing frameworks to detect reasoning failures in vision-language models.

Currently applying to research programs including OpenAI Residency and MATS Summer 2026, while completing my B.Sc. in Programming & Data Science from IIT Madras.

**Research Interests:** Uncertainty Quantification, Vision-Language Models, Hallucination Detection, Epistemic Uncertainty in Agentic Systems
